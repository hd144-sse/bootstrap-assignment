				<h2>Things You Can Do</h2>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>1. Reduce energy use. Adopt energy-saving habits</strong>
						<br>Adopt energy-saving habits. Make it a habit to turn off the lights as you leave a room. Also, replace standard light bulbs with energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs. Turn off your computer and unplug electronics when they are not in use.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info"><strong>2. Change the way you think about transportation. Walk or bike whenever possible.</strong>
						<br> Walk or bike whenever possible. Not only will you reduce your carbon footprint, but your overall level of health will improve and you will save money on parking and gasoline. Take public transit or carpool whenever possible. When purchasing a vehicle look for one with better mileage. Increase your fuel economy when driving by sticking to posted speed limits and avoiding rapid acceleration and excessive braking. </li>
					<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>3. Insulate your home. Insulate yourself</strong>
						<br> Insulate yourself and your home. By properly insulating your home, you can ensure that heat stays in or out depending on the season. You can do this by purchasing windows and window coverings that will block out or keep in warmth, and by sealing any existing cracks. In winter, reduce your thermostat by 2 Â°C to enjoy energy savings and a cozy sweater. </li>
					<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger"><strong>4. Make every drop count</strong>
						<br> Conserve water by fixing drips and leaks, and by installing low-flow shower heads and toilets. Challenge yourself to a speed shower. Turn off water while brushing teeth or shaving. Treating and transporting water requires energy, while water conservation results in reduced energy requirements and carbon emissions.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="list-group"> <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><strong>5. Cool wash and hang to dry</strong>
    <br>
        These are not just washing instructions on a label anymore, but an equation for energy savings. Wash clothing in cold water and hang clothing to dry outside, or indoors on a drying rack. Taking these steps will reduce your electricity bill and also prolong the life of clothing by reducing wear on the fabric caused by dryers. 
    </a> <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-info"><strong>6. High efficiency appliances.</strong><br>
    When replacing appliances, look for high efficiency units. Appliances with ENERGY STAR ratings, an international standard for energy-efficient consumer products, typically utilize a minimum of 20 % less energy. This means savings for you and the environment. 

    </a> <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning"><strong>7. Switch to "green power"</strong><br>
    Research where your power is coming from - wind, water, coal, or solar - and talk to your power provider to determine if a greater percentage could be coming from renewable resources. Encourage power providers to switch to green power and, if possible and/or economically viable, switch to a company offering power from renewable resources.
    </a> <a href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger"><strong>8. Plants, our new best friend</strong>
    <br>
        When gardening, select plants that are well suited to your climate and require minimal watering and attention. Better yet, plant a tree, and it will provide shade and soak up carbon from the atmosphere.
